As for the `nfs.server`, whatever NFS server is OK. Once your NFS server is up and the image-saving feature works fine on your local environmental, you have everything to solve the challenge!

To be more clear, here is my NFS setup:

$ apt install -y nfs-kernel-server nfs-common rpcbind
$ cat /etc/export
/data    172.16.0.0/12(rw,sync)
$ mkdir /data
$ chown nobody.nogroup /data
$ service nfs-kernel-server start
